## Change Log

### Pre-alpha 1 (WIP)
-   [ ] How do I capture an entire world's data into a URL so that GMs can send calendars to their players when the data is only stored on the GM's machine in one browser?
    - This includes party/parties location(s)
    - URLs can only be 2,048 characters long
    - It might have to be a file export
